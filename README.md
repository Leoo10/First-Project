# My First Project

Welcome to my first project! This project aims to showcase my abilities and enhance my programming skills.

# Project Description

The project focuses on my favorite DJ, Armin van Buuren, and combines a website and an online store. I have utilized Angular and Django, along with essential technologies such as TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and Python, to bring this idea to life.

# Installation

To get started with the project, please follow these steps:

1. Install Git on your local machine and register on GitHub.
2. Create a new file and name it as you prefer. Clone my project using the following command:
   <git clone https://github.com/Leoo10/First-Project.git>
3. Create your own branch using the command: <git checkout -b your-branch>
4. Switch to your local main branch and execute: <git pull origin main>
5. Then, switch back to your branch and execute: <git merge main>
6. Next, you need to set up Angular. Firstly, install Angular CLI by running the following command: <npm install -g @angular/cli>
7. Before running my project, you'll also need to install Font Awesome. Execute the following command: <npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free>
8. Before running my project you need to install angular materials, what I'm using for the menu <npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk>
9. Navigate to the "Frontend" directory in the project, where you'll find the "script.ts" file. To deploy my application, use the command: <ng serve -o>
10. Now, let's set up Django. Make sure you have Node.js installed. Install Django by executing the following command: <pip install django>
11. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the Django server: <python manage.py runserver>
12. Before executing this command, ensure that the folder you're in contains the "manage.py" file.
